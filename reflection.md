- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
  I thought inheritance makes the program much efficient, because it allows me to skip the process of writing the same part of the code to do same functions for different classes. It not only helps writing the code to be concise, but also reading and understanding the code.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
  The inheritance using "extends" and "super()" and all the other methods for each class worked. I would give an advice to read the readme.md file thoroughly before starting to write the code, as it helps me a lot to structure the code more easily in my mind.
